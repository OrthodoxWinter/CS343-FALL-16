At the end there was a deadlock among the angels. At the end, the 4 angels formed 2 pairs where each pair of angels were looking at each other (at least that's what I assume was happening. The head angle of the angels were a little dubious). The deadlock occurs due to the fact that angels cannot move if they're being watch. At the end of the video, every angel is being watched by the other angel in the pair. As a result, they're unable to move. In order for an angel to move, the other angel must look away. However, since the two angels are looking at each other, the other angel cannot move precisely for the same reason. So, both angels are waiting for the other to look away, but neither can look away because they're looking at each other and thus can't move. As a result, the angels are waiting on a condition that will be fulfilled, which forms a deadlock
