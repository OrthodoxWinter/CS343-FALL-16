This resumption program cannot be implemented solely by passing fixup routine pointers is because in the original code, the routine f has a _CatchResume block, in which a recursive call is made. The program is set up such there are two possible handlers for f, and which one is used is not known statically. This means that in order in order modify this program to only pass fixup routines, each fixup routine need some way to what the fixup routine is for the previous call to f. This requires the fixup routines to dynamically capture additional information, which is impossible to do if all you're given is routine pointers.
