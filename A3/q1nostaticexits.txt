I used 1000 200 200 200 as my 4 command line arguments
Without optimization, the original solution took 16.337 seconds, and the transformed solution took 17.486

With -O2 optimization, the original solution took 3.268 seconds, and the transformed solution took 3.392

The transformed solution is roughly 1.15 seconds slower than the original, which is about a 7% difference. The reason for the difference in performance is because
the transformed solution required more lines of code to manipulate flag variables to emulate the behavior of the orignal. This means with each loop iteration the 
transformed solution has to execute more operations on average, which makes it slower.

With optimization, the transformed code is 0.124 seconds slower, which is around 4% difference
